  abstract = {Background:               We determined the uptake rate of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and examined associations of clinical and demographic characteristics with CGM use among patients with type 1 diabetes covered by Colorado Medicaid during the first two years of CGM coverage with no out-of-pocket cost.                                         Method:               We retrospectively reviewed data from 892 patients with type 1 diabetes insured by Colorado Medicaid (Colorado Health Program [CHP] and CHP+, Colorado Medicaid expansion). Demographics, insulin pump usage, CGM usage, and hemoglobin A1c (A1c) were extracted from the medical record. Data downloaded into CGM software at clinic appointments were reviewed to determine 30-day use prior to appointments. Subjects with some exposure to CGM were compared to subjects never exposed to CGM, and we examined the effect of CGM use on glycemic control.                                         Results:               Twenty percent of subjects had some exposure to CGM with a median of 22 [interquartile range 8, 29] days wear. Sixty one percent of CGM users had {$>$}85\% sensor wear. Subjects using CGM were more likely to be younger ( P {$<$} .001), have shorter diabetes duration ( P {$<$} .001), and be non-Hispanic White ( P {$<$} .001) than nonusers. After adjusting for age and diabetes duration, combined pump and CGM users had a lower A1c than those using neither technology ( P = .006). Lower A1c was associated with greater CGM use ( P = .002) and increased percent time in range ( P {$<$} .001).                                         Conclusion:               Pediatric Medicaid patients successfully utilized CGM. Expansion of Medicaid coverage for CGM may help improve glycemic control and lessen disparities in clinical outcomes within this population.},
