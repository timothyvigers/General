  abstract = {Background:Excess carbohydrate intake during hypoglycemia can lead to rebound hyperglycemia (RH). We investigated associations between RH and use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) and an rtCGM system?s predictive alert.Methods:RH events were series of sensor glucose values (SGVs) {$>$}180?mg/dL starting within two hours of an antecedent SGV {$<$}70?mg/dL. Events were characterized by their frequency, duration (consecutive SGVs {$>$}180?mg/dL ? five minutes), and severity (area under the glucose concentration-time curve). To assess the impact of rtCGM, data gathered during the four-week baseline phase (without rtCGM) and four-week follow-up phase (with rtCGM) from 75 participants in the HypoDE clinical trial (NCT02671968) of hypoglycemia-unaware individuals were compared. To assess the impact of predictive alerts, we identified a convenience sample of 24 518 users of an rtCGM system without predictive alerts who transitioned to a system whose predictive alert signals an SGV {$\leq$}55?mg/dL within 20?minutes (Dexcom G5 and G6, respectively). RH events from periods of blinded versus unblinded rtCGM wear and from periods of G5 and G6 wear were compared with paired t tests.Results:Compared to RH events in the HypoDE baseline phase, the mean frequency, duration, and severity of events fell by 14\%, 12\%, and 23\%, respectively, in the follow-up phase (all P {$<$} .05). Compared to RH events during G5 use, the mean frequency, duration, and severity of events fell by 7\%, 8\%, and 13\%, respectively, during G6 use (all P {$<$} .001).Conclusions:Rebound hypreglycemia can be objectively quantified and mitigated with rtCGM and rtCGM-based predictive alerts.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) contributes the highest global cancer mortality in women. BC tumors are highly heterogeneous, so subtyping by cell-surface markers is inadequate. Omics-driven tumor stratification is urgently needed to better understand BC and tailor therapies for personalized medicine. We used unsupervised k-means and partition around medoids (pam) to cluster metabolomics data from two data sets. The first comprised 271 BC tumors (data set 1) that were estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ER+, n = 204) or negative (ER\textendash, n = 67) with 162 identified and validated metabolites. The second data set contained 67 BC samples (data set 2; ER+, n = 33; ER\textendash, n = 34) and 352 known metabolites. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was used to identify the most significant metabolites among these clusters, which were then reassigned into new clusters using prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM). Generally, metabolome-defined BC subtypes identified from either data set 1 or data set 2 were different from the well-known receptor- or transcriptome-defined subtypes. Metabolomics-directed clustering of data set 2 identified distinctive BC tumors characterized by metabolome profiles that associated with DNA methylation (p-value = 0.000 048, {$\chi$}2 test). Pathway analysis of cluster metabolites revealed that nitrogen metabolism and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis were highly related to BC subtyping. The pipeline may be run from GitHub: https://github.com/FADHLyemen/Metabolomics\_signature. Our proposed bioinformatics pipeline analyzed metabolomics data from BC tumors, revealing clusters characterized by unique metabolic signatures that may potentially stratify BC patients and tailor precision treatment.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is the most extensively studied mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation. Increasing evidence indicates that DNA methylation is labile in response to nutritional and environmental influences. Alterations in DNA methylation profiles can lead to changes in gene expression, resulting in diverse phenotypes with the potential for increased disease risk. The primary methyl donor for DNA methylation is S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a species generated in the cyclical cellular process called one-carbon metabolism. One-carbon metabolism is catalyzed by several enzymes in the presence of dietary micronutrients, including folate, choline, betaine and other B vitamins. For this reason, nutrition status, particularly micronutrient intake, has been a focal point when investigating epigenetic mechanisms. Although animal evidence linking nutrition and DNA methylation is fairly extensive, epidemiological evidence is less comprehensive. This review serves to integrate studies of the animal in vivo with human epidemiological data pertaining to nutritional regulation of DNA methylation and to further identify areas in which current knowledge is limited.},

The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. The third edition contains major improvements and revisions throughout the book. More than 300 new exercises have been added since the previous edition. Many new examples have been added to illustrate the key ideas of linear algebra. New topics covered in the book include product spaces, quotient spaces, and dual spaces. Beautiful new formatting creates pages with an unusually pleasant appearance in both print and electronic versions. No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus the text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator},

  abstract = {Background: Glycemic variability is currently under scrutiny as a possible predictor of the complications of diabetes. The manual process for estimating a now classical measure of glycemic variability, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), is both tedious and prone to error, and there is a special need for an automated method to calculate the MAGE from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data.Methods: An automated algorithm for identifying the peaks and nadirs corresponding to the glycemic excursions required for the MAGE calculation has been developed. The algorithm takes a column of timed glucose measurements and generates a plot joining the peaks and nadirs required for estimating the MAGE. It returns estimates of the MAGE for both upward and downward excursions, together with several other indices of glycemic variability.Results: Details of the application of the algorithm to CGM data collected over a 48-h period are provided, together with graphical illustrations of the intermediate stages in identifying the peaks and nadirs required for the MAGE. Application of the algorithm to 104\,CGM datasets (92 from children with diabetes and 12 from controls) generated plots that, on visual inspection, were all found to have identified the peaks, nadirs, and excursions correctly.Conclusions: The proposed algorithm eliminates the tedium and/or errors of manually identifying and measuring countable excursions in CGM data in order to estimate the MAGE. It can also be used to calculate the MAGE from ``sparse'' blood glucose measurements, such as those collected in home blood glucose monitoring.},

Combining several metabolomics assays can yield datasets for more than 800 structurally identified metabolites. However, biological interpretations of metabolic regulation in these datasets are hindered by inherent limits of pathway enrichment statistics. We have developed ChemRICH, a statistical enrichment approach that is based on chemical similarity rather than sparse biochemical knowledge annotations. ChemRICH utilizes structure similarity and chemical ontologies to map all known metabolites and name metabolic modules. Unlike pathway mapping, this strategy yields study-specific, non-overlapping sets of all identified metabolites. Subsequent enrichment statistics is superior to pathway enrichments because ChemRICH sets have a self-contained size where p-values do not rely on the size of a background database. We demonstrate ChemRICH's efficiency on a public metabolomics data set discerning the development of type 1 diabetes in a non-obese diabetic mouse model.

We show that such selected intervals fail to provide the assumed coverage probability. By generalizing the false discovery rate (FDR) approach from multiple testing to selected multiple CIs, we suggest the false coverage-statement rate (FCR) as a measure of interval coverage following selection. A general procedure is then introduced, offering FCR control at level q under any selection rule. The procedure constructs a marginal CI for each selected parameter, but instead of the confidence level 1 - q being used marginally, q is divided by the number of parameters considered and multiplied by the number selected. If we further use the FDR controlling testing procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg for selecting the parameters, the newly suggested procedure offers CIs that are dual to the testing procedure and are shown to be optimal in the independent case. Under the positive regression dependency condition of Benjamini and Yekutieli, the FCR is controlled for one-sided tests and CIs, as well as for a modification for two-sided testing. Results for general dependency are also given. Finally, using the equivalence of the CIs to testing, we prove that the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg offers directional FDR control as conjectured.},

  abstract = {In biomedical literature, numerous prediction models for clinical outcomes have been developed based either on clinical data or, more recently, on high-throughput molecular data (omics data). Prediction models based on both types of data, however, are less common, although some recent studies suggest that a suitable combination of clinical and molecular information may lead to models with better predictive abilities. This is probably due to the fact that it is not straightforward to combine data with different characteristics and dimensions (poorly characterized high-dimensional omics data, well-investigated low-dimensional clinical data). In this paper, we analyze two publicly available datasets related to breast cancer and neuroblastoma, respectively, in order to show some possible ways to combine clinical and omics data into a prediction model of time-to-event outcome. Different strategies and statistical methods are exploited. The results are compared and discussed according to different criteria, including the discriminative ability of the models, computed on a validation dataset.

These strategies include the construction and quality of tandem mass spectral databases such as the coalition of MassBank repositories and investigations of MS/MS matching confidence. We present in silico fragmentation tools such as MS-FINDER, CFM-ID, MetFrag, ChemDistiller and CSI:FingerID that can annotate compounds from existing structure databases and that have been used in the CASMI (critical assessment of small molecule identification) contests. Furthermore, the use of retention time models from liquid chromatography and the utility of collision cross-section modelling from ion mobility experiments are covered.

Accompanied by a dramatic reduction in cost since its introduction in 2004, NGS technology has provided a new way of addressing a wide range of biological and biomedical questions, from the study of human genetic disease to the analysis of gene expression, protein-DNA interactions, and patterns of DNA methylation. The data generated by NGS instruments comprise huge numbers of very short DNA sequences, or ``reads,'' that carry little information by themselves. These reads therefore have to be pieced together by well-engineered algorithms to reconstruct biologically meaningful measurements, such as the level of expression of a gene. To solve this complex, high-dimensional puzzle, reads must be mapped back to a reference genome to determine their origin. Due to sequencing errors and to genuine differences between the reference genome and the individual being sequenced, this mapping process must be tolerant of mismatches, insertions, and deletions. Although optimal alignment algorithms to solve this problem have long been available, the practical requirements of aligning hundreds of millions of short reads to the 3-billion-base-pair-long human genome have stimulated the development of new, more efficient methods, which today are used routinely throughout the world for the analysis of NGS data.},

A lactulose/mannitol (lac/man) intestinal permeability test was performed at 1 and 7 days (steady-state method, n = 72), then at 30 days of life (single oral load, n = 47). Urinary lactulose and mannitol were measured by HPLC. The mean lac/man urinary ratio dropped from 1.27 {$\pm$} 0.73 (day 1) to 0.34 {$\pm$} 0.36 at day 7 and to 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.21 at day 30. At 7 days BF infants showed a significantly lower lac/man urinary ratio (0.22 {$\pm$} 0.25) than the CM group (0.47 {$\pm$} 0.41). The human neonate shows a developmental pattern of sugar intestinal permeability that resembles gut closure observed in other mammals. Intestinal permeability decreases faster in breast-fed babics than in those fed with adapted or HA formulas.         \textcopyright{} Lippincott-Raven Publishers.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) are often used to measure the ability of survival models to predict future risk. Estimation of these parameters is complicated by the fact that these parameters are time-dependent and by the fact that censoring affects their estimation just as it affects estimation of survival curves or coefficients of survival regression models. The authors present several estimators that overcome these complications. One approach is a recursive calculation over the ordered times of events, analogous to the Kaplan\textendash Meier approach to survival function estimation. Another is to first apply Bayes' theorem to write the parameters of interest in terms of conditional survival functions that are then estimated by survival analysis methods. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform well in practical situations, when compared with an estimator (c-statistic, from logistic regression) that ignores time. An illustration with data from a cardiovascular follow-up study is provided. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The use of external controls in genome-wide association study (GWAS) can significantly increase the size and diversity of the control sample, enabling high-resolution ancestry matching and enhancing the power to detect association signals. However, the aggregation of controls from multiple sources is challenging due to batch effects, difficulty in identifying genotyping errors, and the use of different genotyping platforms. These obstacles have impeded the use of external controls in GWAS and can lead to spurious results if not carefully addressed. We propose a unified data harmonization pipeline that includes an iterative approach to quality control (QC) and imputation, implemented before and after merging cohorts and arrays. We apply this harmonization pipeline to aggregate 27,517 European control samples from 16 collections within dbGaP. We leverage these harmonized controls to conduct a GWAS of Crohn's disease. We demonstrate a boost in power over using the cohort samples alone, and that our procedure results in summary statistics free of any significant batch effects. This harmonization pipeline for aggregating genotype data from multiple sources can also serve other applications where individual level genotypes, rather than summary statistics, are required.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Altered metabolic pathways predispose to several different pathologies ranging from diabetes to cancer. Specific transcriptional programs tightly regulate the enzymes involved in cell metabolism and dictate cell fate regulating the differentiation into specialized cell types that contribute to metabolic adaptation in higher organisms. For these reasons, it is of extreme importance to identify signaling pathways and transcription factors that positively and negatively regulate metabolism. Genomic organization allows a plethora of different strategies to regulate transcription. Importantly, large evidence suggests that the quality of diet and the caloric regimen can influence the epigenetic state of our genome and that certain metabolic pathways are also epigenetically controlled reveling a tight crosstalk between metabolism and epigenomes. Here we focus our attention on methylation-based epigenetic reactions, on how different metabolic pathways control these activities, and how these can influence metabolism. Altogether, the recent discoveries linking these apparent distant areas reveal that an exciting field of research is emerging.},

Since its first release in 2009, MetaboAnalyst has evolved significantly to meet the ever-expanding bioinformatics demands from the rapidly growing metabolomics community. In addition to providing a variety of data processing and normalization procedures, MetaboAnalyst supports a wide array of functions for statistical, functional, as well as data visualization tasks. Some of the most widely used approaches include PCA (principal component analysis), PLS-DA (partial least squares discriminant analysis), clustering analysis and visualization, MSEA (metabolite set enrichment analysis), MetPA (metabolic pathway analysis), biomarker selection via ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis, as well as time series and power analysis. The current version of MetaboAnalyst (4.0) features a complete overhaul of the user interface and significantly expanded underlying knowledge bases (compound database, pathway libraries, and metabolite sets). Three new modules have been added to support pathway activity prediction directly from mass peaks, biomarker meta-analysis, and network-based multi-omics data integration. To enable more transparent and reproducible analysis of metabolomic data, we have released a companion R package (MetaboAnalystR) to complement the web-based application.

Many of these association tests may be correlated with one another because of linkage disequilibrium between nearby markers and correlation between traits and models. Permutation tests and simulation-based methods are often employed to adjust groups of correlated tests for multiple testing, since conventional methods such as Bonferroni correction are overly conservative when tests are correlated. We present here a method of computing P values adjusted for correlated tests (PACT) that attains the accuracy of permutation or simulation-based tests in much less computation time, and we show that our method applies to many common association tests that are based on multiple traits, markers, and genetic models. Simulation demonstrates that PACT attains the power of permutation testing and provides a valid adjustment for hundreds of correlated association tests. In data analyzed as part of the Finland\textendash United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) study, we observe a near one-to-one relationship (r2{$>$}.999) between PACT and the corresponding permutation-based P values, achieving the same precision as permutation testing but thousands of times faster.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We measured 25(OH)D concentrations in 720 case and 2,610 control plasma samples and genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms from seven vitamin D metabolism genes in 8,517 case, 10,438 control, and 1,933 family samples. We tested genetic variants influencing 25(OH)D metabolism for an association with both circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and disease status. RESULTS Type 1 diabetic patients have lower circulating levels of 25(OH)D than similarly aged subjects from the British population. Only 4.3 and 18.6\% of type 1 diabetic patients reached optimal levels ({$\geq$}75 nmol/L) of 25(OH)D for bone health in the winter and summer, respectively. We replicated the associations of four vitamin D metabolism genes (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1) with 25(OH)D in control subjects. In addition to the previously reported association between type 1 diabetes and CYP27B1 (P = 1.4 \texttimes{} 10-4), we obtained consistent evidence of type 1 diabetes being associated with DHCR7 (P = 1.2 \texttimes{} 10-3) and CYP2R1 (P = 3.0 \texttimes{} 10-3). CONCLUSIONS Circulating levels of 25(OH)D in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes vary seasonally and are under the same genetic control as in the general population but are much lower. Three key 25(OH)D metabolism genes show consistent evidence of association with type 1 diabetes risk, indicating a genetic etiological role for vitamin D deficiency in type 1 diabetes.},

An important and common question in DNA microarray experiments is the identification of differentially expressed genes, that is, genes whose expression levels are associated with a response or covariate of interest. The biological question of differential expression can be restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test for each gene of the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and the responses or covariates. As a typical microarray experiment measures expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously, large multiplicity problems are generated. This article discusses different approaches to multiple hypothesis testing in the context of DNA microarray experiments and compares the procedures on microarray and simulated data sets.},

  abstract = {Background: Modeling the various error components affecting continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors is very important (e.g., to generate realistic scenarios for developing and testing CGM-based applications in type 1 diabetes simulators). Recent work has focused on some error components (i.e., blood-to-interstitium delay, calibration, and random noise), but key events such as transient faults have not been investigated in depth. We propose two mathematical models that describe the disconnections and compression artifacts.Materials and Methods: A dataset of 72 subjects monitored with the Dexcom (San Diego, CA) G4\textregistered{} Platinum sensor is considered. Disconnections and compression artifacts have been isolated, and some basic statistical parameters (e.g., frequency and duration) have been extracted. A Markov chain model is proposed to describe the dynamics of a disconnection, and the effect of a compression artifact in the CGM profile is modeled as the output of a first-order linear dynamic system driven by a rectangular function.Results: The great majority of disconnections (approximately 90\%) lasted less than 20\,min. Compression artifact median (5th\textendash 95th percentiles) values were 45 (30\textendash 70) min for the duration and 24 (10\textendash 48) mg/dL for the amplitude. Both disconnections and compression artifacts happened with almost equal probability during the 7 days of monitoring. Disconnections were more frequent during the day and compression artifacts during the night. A three-state Markov model is shown to be effective to describe the single disconnection. The asymmetric shape of compression artifact is well fitted by the proposed model.Conclusions: The provided models are sufficiently accurate for simulation purposes (e.g., to create more challenging and realistic scenarios) to test real-time fault detection algorithms and artificial pancreas closed-loop controllers.},

First-degree relatives of individuals with T1DM were recruited from the Denver metropolitan area.A total of 1835 children at increased genetic risk for T1DM followed up from birth with complete prospective assessment of infant diet. Fifty-three children developed T1DM.Early (\&lt;4 months of age) and late ({$\geq$}6 months of age) first exposure to solid foods compared with first exposures at 4 to 5 months of age (referent).Risk for T1DM diagnosed by a physician.Both early and late first exposure to any solid food predicted development of T1DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95\% CI, 1.04-3.51, and HR, 3.02; 95\% CI, 1.26-7.24, respectively), adjusting for the HLA-DR genotype, first-degree relative with T1DM, maternal education, and delivery type. Specifically, early exposure to fruit and late exposure to rice/oat predicted T1DM (HR, 2.23; 95\% CI, 1.14-4.39, and HR, 2.88; 95\% CI, 1.36-6.11, respectively), while breastfeeding at the time of introduction to wheat/barley conferred protection (HR, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.86). Complicated vaginal delivery was also a predictor of T1DM (HR, 1.93; 95\% CI, 1.03-3.61).These results suggest the safest age to introduce solid foods in children at increased genetic risk for T1DM is between 4 and 5 months of age. Breastfeeding while introducing new foods may reduce T1DM risk.},

  abstract = {Although vertebrate DNA is generally depleted in the dinucleotide CpG, it has recently been shown that some vertebrate genes contain CpG islands, regions of DNA with a high G + C content and a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. In this study, a large number of sequences of vertebrate genes were screened for the presence of CpG islands. Each CpG island was then analysed in terms of length, nucleotide composition, frequency of CpG dinucleotides, and location relative to the transcription unit of the associated gene. CpG islands were associated with the 5{${'}$} ends of all housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3{${'}$} ends of some tissue-specific genes. A few genes contained both 5{${'}$} and 3{${'}$} CpG islands, separated by several thousand base-pairs of CpG-depleted DNA. The 5{${'}$} CpG islands extended through 5{${'}$}-flanking DNA, exons and introns, whereas most of the 3{${'}$} CpG islands appeared to be associated with exons. CpG islands were generally found in the same position relative to the transcription unit of equivalent genes in different species, with some notable exceptions. The locations of GC boxes, composed of the sequence GGGCGG or its reverse complement CCGCCC, were investigated relative to the location of CpG islands. GC boxes were found to be rare in CpG-depleted DNA and plentiful in CpG islands, where they occurred in 3{${'}$} CpG islands, as well as in 5{${'}$} CpG islands associated with tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. GC boxes were located both upstream and downstream from the transcription start site of genes with 5{${'}$} CpG islands. Thus, GC boxes appeared to be a feature of CpG islands in general, rather than a feature of the promoter region of housekeeping genes. Two theories for the maintenance of a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands were tested: that CpG islands in methylated genomes are maintained, despite a tendency for 5mCpG to mutate by deamination to TpG + CpA, by the structural stability of a high G + C content alone, and that CpG islands associated with exons result from some selective importance of the arginine codon CGX. Neither of these theories could account for the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the sequences analysed. Possible functions of CpG islands in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression were discussed, and were related to theories for the maintenance of CpG islands as ``methylationfree zones'' in germline DNA.},

  abstract = {Temporal event data are collected across a broad range of domains, and a variety of visual analytics techniques have been developed to empower analysts working with this form of data. These techniques generally display aggregate statistics computed over sets of event sequences that share common patterns. Such techniques are often hindered, however, by the high-dimensionality of many real-world event sequence datasets which can prevent effective aggregation. A common coping strategy for this challenge is to group event types together prior to visualization, as a pre-process, so that each group can be represented within an analysis as a single event type. However, computing these event groupings as a pre-process also places significant constraints on the analysis. This paper presents a new visual analytics approach for dynamic hierarchical dimension aggregation. The approach leverages a predefined hierarchy of dimensions to computationally quantify the informativeness, with respect to a measure of interest, of alternative levels of grouping within the hierarchy at runtime. This information is then interactively visualized, enabling users to dynamically explore the hierarchy to select the most appropriate level of grouping to use at any individual step within an analysis. Key contributions include an algorithm for interactively determining the most informative set of event groupings for a specific analysis context, and a scented scatter-plus-focus visualization design with an optimization-based layout algorithm that supports interactive hierarchical exploration of alternative event type groupings. We apply these techniques to high-dimensional event sequence data from the medical domain and report findings from domain expert interviews.},

DNA methylation has numerous functions: it is implicated in the repression of transposons and genes, but is also associated with actively transcribed gene bodies and, in some cases, with gene activation per se. In recent years, sensitive technologies have been developed that allow the interrogation of DNA methylation patterns from a small number of cells. The use of these technol\- ogies has greatly improved our knowledge of DNA methylation dynamics and heterogeneity in embryos and in specific tissues. Combined with genetic analyses, it is increasingly apparent that regulation of DNA methylation erasure and (re-)establishment varies considerably between different developmental stages. In this Review{$\mkern1mu$}, we discuss the mechanisms and functions of DNA methylation and demethylation in both mice and humans at CpG-rich promoters, gene bodies and transposable elements. We highlight the dynamic erasure and re-establishment of DNA methyl\-ation in embryonic, germline and somatic cell development. Finally{$\mkern1mu$}, we provide insights into DNA methylation gained from studying genetic diseases.},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so\textemdash and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through August 2015. We conducted a qualitative review of cross-sectional and prospective studies. Additionally, meta-analyses of metabolite markers, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and type 2 diabetes risk were conducted, and multivariable-adjusted relative risks of type 2 diabetes were calculated per study-specific SD difference in a given metabolite. RESULTS We identified 27 cross-sectional and 19 prospective publications reporting associations of metabolites and prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes. Carbohydrate (glucose and fructose), lipid (phospholipids, sphingomyelins, and triglycerides), and amino acid (branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, glycine, and glutamine) metabolites were higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects. Prospective studies provided evidence that blood concentrations of several metabolites, including hexoses, branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, phospholipids, and triglycerides, were associated with the incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. We meta-analyzed results from eight prospective studies that reported risk estimates for metabolites and type 2 diabetes, including 8,000 individuals of whom 1,940 had type 2 diabetes. We found 36\% higher risk of type 2 diabetes per study-specific SD difference for isoleucine (pooled relative risk 1.36 [1.24\textendash 1.48]; I2 = 9.5\%), 36\% for leucine (1.36 [1.17\textendash 1.58]; I2 = 37.4\%), 35\% for valine (1.35 [1.19\textendash 1.53]; I2 = 45.8\%), 36\% for tyrosine (1.36 [1.19\textendash 1.55]; I2 = 51.6\%), and 26\% for phenylalanine (1.26 [1.10\textendash 1.44]; I2 = 56\%). Glycine and glutamine were inversely associated with type 2 diabetes risk (0.89 [0.81\textendash 0.96] and 0.85 [0.82\textendash 0.89], respectively; both I2 = 0.0\%). CONCLUSIONS In studies using high-throughput metabolomics, several blood amino acids appear to be consistently associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.},

The tutorial assumes one has had at least a year of college-level calculus, some graduate level exposure to random processes, and familiarity with terms like ``closed '' and ``open. '' The focus is on the terms and ideas relevant to applied probability and information theory. There are no proofs and no exercises. Measure theory is a bit like grammar, many people communicate clearly without worrying about all the details, but the details do exist and for good reasons. There are a number of great texts that do measure theory justice. This is not one of them. Rather this is a hack way to get the basic ideas down so you can read through research papers and follow what's going on. Hopefully, you'll get curious and excited enough about the details to check out some of the references for a deeper understanding. A Something to measure First, we need something to measure. So we define a ``measurable space. '' A measurable space is a collection of events B, and the set of all outcomes {$\Omega$}, which is sometimes called the sample space. Given a collection of possible events B, why do you need to state {$\Omega$}? For one, having a sample space makes it possible to define complements of sets; if the event F {$\in$} B, then the event FC is the set of outcomes in {$\Omega$} that are disjoint from F. A measurable space is written},

Although there are many different methods to deal with incomplete data, MI has become one of the leading methods.

This tutorial does not attempt to cover all the material concerning MI, but rather provides an overview and combines together the theory behind MI, the implementation of MI, and discusses increasing possibilities of the use of MI using commercial and free software. We illustrate some of the major points using an example from an Alzheimer disease (AD) study. In this AD study, while clinical data are available for all subjects, postmortem data are only available for the subset of those who died and underwent an autopsy.

  abstract = {This easy-to-follow applied book expands upon the authors' prior work on semiparametric regression to include the use of R software. In 2003, authors Ruppert and Wand co-wrote Semiparametric Regression with R.J. Carroll, which introduced the techniques and benefits of semiparametric regression in a concise and user-friendly fashion. Fifteen years later, semiparametric regression is applied widely, powerful new methodology is continually being developed, and advances in the R computing environment make it easier than ever before to carry out analyses. Semiparametric Regression with R introduces the basic concepts of semiparametric regression with a focus on applications and R software. This volume features case studies from environmental, economic, financial, and other fields. The examples and corresponding code can be used or adapted to apply semiparametric regression to a wide range of problems. It contains more than fifty exercises, and the accompanying HRW package contains all datasets and scripts used in the book, as well as some useful R functions. This book is suitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, as well as a guide for statistically-oriented practitioners, and could be used in conjunction with Semiparametric Regression. Readers are assumed to have a basic knowledge of R and some exposure to linear models. For the underpinning principles, calculus-based probability, statistics, and linear algebra are desirable},

  abstract = {Background: Given the high technical reproducibility and orders of magnitude greater resolution than microarrays, next-generation sequencing of mRNA (RNA-Seq) is quickly becoming the de facto standard for measuring levels of gene expression in biological experiments. Two important questions must be taken into consideration when designing a particular experiment, namely, 1) how deep does one need to sequence? and, 2) how many biological replicates are necessary to observe a significant change in expression?Results: Based on the gene expression distributions from 127 RNA-Seq experiments, we find evidence that 91\%\,{$\pm$}\,4\% of all annotated genes are sequenced at a frequency of 0.1 times per million bases mapped, regardless of sample source. Based on this observation, and combining this information with other parameters such as biological variation and technical variation that we empirically estimate from our large datasets, we developed a model to estimate the statistical power needed to identify differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq experiments.Conclusions: Our results provide a needed reference for ensuring RNA-Seq gene expression studies are conducted with the optimally sample size, power, and sequencing depth. We also make available both R code and an Excel worksheet for investigators to calculate for their own experiments.},

  abstract = {Summary. ROC curves are a popular method for displaying sensitivity and specificity of a continuous marker, X, for a binary disease variable, D. However, many disease outcomes are time dependent, D(t, and ROC curves that vary as a function of time may be mire appropriate. A common examples of a time-dependent variable is vital status, where D(t) = 1 if a patient has died prior to time t and zero otherwise. We propose summarizing the discrimination potential of a marker X, measured at baseline (t= 0), by calculating ROC Curves for cumulative disease or death incidence by time t, which we denote as ROC(t). A typical complexity with survival data is that observations may be censored. Two ROC curve estimators are proposed that can accommodate censored data. A simple estimator is based on using the Kaplan-Meier estimated for each possible subset X {$>$} c. However, this estimator does not guarantee the necessary condition that sensitivity and specificity are monotone in X. An alternative estimator that does guarantee monotonicity is based on a nearest neighbor estimator for the bivariate distribution function of (X, T), where T represents survival time (Akritas, M. J., 1994, Annals of Statistics22, 1299\textendash 1327). We present an example where ROC(t) is used to compare a standard and a modified flow cytometry measurement for predicting survival after detection of breast cancer and an example where the ROC(t) curve displays the impact of modifying eligibility criteria for sample size and power in HIV prevention trials.},

We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Objective Our aim was to elucidate the role of diet in type 1 diabetes (T1D) by examining combinations of nutrient intake in the progression from islet autoimmunity (IA) to T1D. Methods We measured 2457 metabolites and dietary intake at the time of seroconversion in 132 IA-positive children in the prospective Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young. IA was defined as the first of two consecutive visits positive for at least one autoantibody (insulin, GAD, IA-2, or ZnT8). By December 2018, 40 children progressed to T1D. Intakes of 38 nutrients were estimated from semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires. We tested the association of each metabolite with progression to T1D using multivariable Cox regression. Nutrient patterns that best explained variation in candidate metabolites were identified using reduced rank regression (RRR), and their association with progression to T1D was tested using Cox regression adjusting for age at seroconversion and high-risk HLA genotype. Results In stepwise selection, 22 nutrients significantly predicted at least two of the 13 most significant metabolites associated with progression to T1D, and were included in RRR. A nutrient pattern corresponding to intake lower in linoleic acid, niacin, and riboflavin, and higher in total sugars, explained 18\% of metabolite variability. Children scoring higher on this metabolite-related nutrient pattern at seroconversion had increased risk for progressing to T1D (HR = 3.17, 95\%CI = 1.42-7.05). Conclusions Combinations of nutrient intake reflecting candidate metabolites are associated with increased risk of T1D, and may help focus dietary prevention efforts.},

  abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a collection of groundbreaking technologies for the mass profiling of DNA and RNA sequences. Over the last decades, these technologies have been constantly scaling up, resulting in an increase of throughput and a decrease of required time and overall experiment cost. From these advancements, there is a significant societal benefit since the information that is collected from individual and population level genomic analysis is gradually incorporated in the therapeutic and preventive guidelines in modern healthcare systems. NGS is practically the core of many techniques that can be used to assess a wide spectrum of genetic information within a biological system. Here, we present an introduction of NGS techniques for variant detection through sequencing data, gene expression analysis through RNA-seq data, and protein-DNA interactions through ChIP-seq data. We focus mainly on the computational considerations and challenges of the analysis of these types of data. Specifically, we review the possible types of analysis and present available tool options and we discuss on best practices for quality control and downstream analysis. We also provide directions for data integration with existing genomic databases and other online resources.},

  abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is generally considered to be a chronic, immune-mediated disease with a subclinical prodrome during which {$\beta$} cell autoimmunity becomes overt disease at a variable rate in genetically susceptible individuals. Accumulated evidence supports a critical role of environmental factors in its development. Prospective birth cohort studies show that the first signs of {$\beta$} cell autoimmunity may be initiated during the first year of life. This implies that risk factors for {$\beta$} cell autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes must be operative in infancy. Early nutrition provides essential exogenous exposures in that period. This article discusses the role of factors related to infant nutrition in the development of {$\beta$} cell autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes and the potential mechanistic pathways involved. So far, no specific dietary factor has been shown to be an unequivocal risk factor for {$\beta$} cell autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes, and there are a number of contradictory observations with regard to the effect of various foods. This may reflect geographic and cultural differences in infant-feeding practices. Most studies suggest that the early introduction of complex foreign proteins may be a risk factor for {$\beta$} cell autoimmunity, and a pilot intervention trial has implied that weaning to a highly hydrolyzed formula may decrease the risk of {$\beta$} cell autoimmunity. Lack of vitamin D supplementation and accelerated growth might increase the risk of type 1 diabetes. Additional work, which includes the application of modern approaches such as metabolomics and epigenomics, is needed to discern the contribution of dietary factors in infancy to the diabetic disease process.},

An infant diet history was collected from 164 IDDM subjects from the Colorado IDDM Registry with a mean birth year of 1973, and 145 nondiabetic population control subjects who were frequency matched to diabetic subjects on age, sex, and ethnicity. Early exposure was defined as exposure occurring before 3 mo of age. After controlling for ethnicity, birth order, and family income, more diabetic subjects were exposed early to cow's milk (OR 4.5, 95\% Cl 0.9\textendash 21.4) and solid foods (OR 2.5, Cl 1.4\textendash 4.3) than control subjects. To examine this association while accounting for the genetic susceptibility to IDDM, we defined individuals as high and low risk by an HLA-DQB1 molecular marker. Early exposure to cow's milk was not associated with elevated risk for IDDM in low-risk individuals. Relative to unexposed low-risk individuals, early exposure to cow's milk was strongly associated in individuals with a high risk marker (OR 11.3, Cl 1.2\textendash 102.0). Similar findings were observed for early exposure to solid foods. These data indicate that early exposure to cow's milk and solid foods may be associated with increased risk of IDDM. The inclusion of HLA-encoded risk in the analyses demonstrates the combined effect of genetic and environmental factors.},

We studied whether persistent physical activity compared with inactivity has a global effect on serum metabolome toward reduced cardiometabolic disease risk.Methods and Results\textemdash Sixteen same-sex twin pairs (mean age, 60 years) were selected from a cohort of twin pairs on the basis of their {$>$}30-year discordance for physical activity. Persistently ({$\geq$}5 years) active and inactive groups in 3 population-based cohorts (mean ages, 31\textendash 52 years) were also studied (1037 age- and sex-matched pairs). Serum metabolome was quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We used permutation analysis to estimate the significance of the multivariate effect combined across all metabolic measures; univariate effects were estimated by paired testing in twins and in matched pairs in the cohorts, and by meta-analysis over all substudies. Persistent physical activity was associated with the multivariate metabolic profile in the twins (P=0.003), and a similar pattern was observed in all 3 population cohorts with differing mean ages. Isoleucine, {$\alpha$}1-acid glycoprotein, and glucose were lower in the physically active than in the inactive individuals (P{$<$}0.001 in meta-analysis); serum fatty acid composition was shifted toward a less saturated profile; and lipoprotein subclasses were shifted toward lower very-low-density lipoprotein (P{$<$}0.001) and higher large and very large high-density lipoprotein (P{$<$}0.001) particle concentrations.

Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data.

Even worse, an existing trajectory outlier detection algorithm has limited capability to detect outlying sub- trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel partition-and-detect framework for trajectory outlier detection, which partitions a trajectory into a set of line segments, and then, detects outlying line segments for trajectory outliers. The primary advantage of this framework is to detect outlying sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-detect framework, we develop a trajectory outlier detection algorithm TRAOD. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and detection. For the first phase, we propose a two-level trajectory partitioning strategy that ensures both high quality and high efficiency. For the second phase, we present a hybrid of the distance-based and density-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that TRAOD correctly detects outlying sub-trajectories from real trajectory data.},

  abstract = {In an 8-year longitudinal study of Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, we used statistical techniques that are novel and depend on minimal assumptions to compare longitudinal measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Individuals enrolled with new-onset microalbuminuria either progressed to macroalbuminuria (progressors, n = 13) or did not progress (nonprogressors, n = 13) during follow-up. Subjects with new-onset macroalbuminuria at screening were also followed (n = 22). Patients had their GFR determined serially by urinary iothalamate clearances (average 11 clearances; range 6\textendash 19). GFR courses of individuals were modeled using an adaptation of smoothing and regression cubic B-splines. Group comparisons were based on five-component vectors of fitted GFR values using a permutation approach to a Hotelling's T2 statistic. GFR profiles of initially microalbuminuric progressors differed significantly from those of nonprogressors (P = 0.003). There were no significant baseline differences between progressors and nonprogressors with respect to any measured clinical parameters. The course of GFR in the first 4 yr following progression to macroalbuminuria in initially microalbuminuric subjects did not differ from that in newly screened macroalbuinuric subjects (P = 0.27). Without imposing simplifying models on the data, the statistical techniques used demonstrate that the courses of decline of GFR in definable subgroups of initially microalbuminuric diabetic Pima Indians, although generally progressive, follow distinct trajectories that are related to the extent of glomerular barrier dysfunction, as reflected by the evolution from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria.},

However, the DDA datasets contain a significant number of missing values (MVs) that severely hinders proper analysis. Existing literature suggests that different imputation methods should be used for the two types of MVs: missing completely at random or missing not at random. However, the simulated or biased datasets utilized by most of such studies offer few clues about the composition and thus proper imputation of MVs in real-life proteomic datasets. Moreover, the impact of imputation methods on downstream differential expression analysis\textemdash a critical goal for many biomedical projects\textemdash is largely undetermined. In this study, we investigated public DDA datasets of various tissue/sample types to determine the composition of MVs in them. We then developed simulated datasets that imitate the MV profile of real-life datasets. Using such datasets, we compared the impact of various popular imputation methods on the analysis of differentially expressed proteins. Finally, we make recommendations on which imputation method(s) to use for proteomic data beyond just DDA datasets.},

Two-part models with logistic models for part I, probability of use (ie, nonzero cost) and log-link models for part II, mean cost of use (ie, nonzero cost) are often used. Effects of exposures or covariates on total (marginal) cost are often of interest, and recent work has proposed useful methods. Factors that affect total cost do so through a combination of effects on probability of use and cost of use. Such a decomposition is needed to understand and act on factors that affect total cost, but little work has been done on this question. This paper presents two new methods for decomposing effects on total cost, namely, an adjusted approach based on log-binomial models for part I and a population average approach based on counterfactual arguments. Extensive simulations illustrate performance, interpretation, and robustness over a wide range of data features. The method is applied to risk-adjusted 30-day outpatient cardiac cost for patients following percutaneous coronary intervention from the Department of Veterans Affairs Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking Program. Results illustrate the simple decomposition of effects on total cost into components for probability of use and cost of use.},

The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. Methods We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA\_tutorial/). In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual-level scores of genetic risk. Results The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands-on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users. Conclusions By providing theoretical background and hands-on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.},

However, the analysis of these data under free-living conditions is not feasible with current statistical techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a new functional representation of biosensor data, termed the glucodensity, together with a data analysis framework based on distances between them. The new data analysis procedure is illustrated through an application in diabetes with continuous-time glucose monitoring (CGM) data. In this domain, we show marked improvement with respect to state-of-the-art analysis methods. In particular, our findings demonstrate that (i) the glucodensity possesses an extraordinary clinical sensitivity to capture the typical biomarkers used in the standard clinical practice in diabetes; (ii) previous biomarkers cannot accurately predict glucodensity, so that the latter is a richer source of information and; (iii) the glucodensity is a natural generalization of the time in range metric, this being the gold standard in the handling of CGM data. Furthermore, the new method overcomes many of the drawbacks of time in range metrics and provides more in-depth insight into assessing glucose metabolism.},

As the nitrogen donor in nitric oxide (NO{$\cdot$}) synthesis, arginine and its metabolic products are integrally linked to vascular health and information. We hypothesized that derangements in this pathway could explain, in part, increased atherosclerotic risk in CKD. We developed a targeted metabolomic platform to profile quantitatively arginine metabolites in plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Male low-density lipoprotein receptor defcient (LDLr-/-) mice at age 6 weeks were subjected to sham or 5/6 nephrectomy surgery to induce CKD. Subsequently, the animals were maintained on high fat diet for 24 weeks. Targeted metabolomic analysis of arginine metabolites in plasma was performed by isotope dilution LC/MS including asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA), symmetric dimethyl arginine (SDMA), N-mono-methylarginine (NMMA), arginine and citrulline. Although elevated plasma levels of ADMA and SDMA were found in the CKD mice, only higher ADMA level correlated with degree of atherosclerosis. No significant differences were noted in levels of NMMA between the groups. CKD mice had high levels of citrulline and arginine, but ADMA levels had no correlation with either of these metabolites. These fndings strongly implicate altered arginine methylation and accumulation of ADMA, may in part contribute to CKD accelerated atherosclerosis. It raises the possibility that interrupting pathways that generate ADMA or enhance its metabolism may have therapeutic potential in mitigating atherosclerosis.},

Existing free BN software packages either discretize continuous variables, which can lead to information loss, or do not include inference routines, which makes prediction with the BN impossible. We present CGBayesNets, a BN package focused around prediction of a clinical phenotype from mixed discrete and continuous variables, which fills these gaps. CGBayesNets implements Bayesian likelihood and inference algorithms for the conditional Gaussian Bayesian network (CGBNs) formalism, one appropriate for predicting an outcome of interest from, e.g., multimodal genomic data. We provide four different network learning algorithms, each making a different tradeoff between computational cost and network likelihood. CGBayesNets provides a full suite of functions for model exploration and verification, including cross validation, bootstrapping, and AUC manipulation. We highlight several results obtained previously with CGBayesNets, including predictive models of wood properties from tree genomics, leukemia subtype classification from mixed genomic data, and robust prediction of intensive care unit mortality outcomes from metabolomic profiles. We also provide detailed example analysis on public metabolomic and gene expression datasets.

The most widely used continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are percutaneous, with the sensor residing in the interstitial space. Inaccuracies in percutaneous CGM readings during periods of lying on the devices (e.g., in various sleeping positions) have been anecdotally reported but not systematically studied.Methods:In order to assess the impact of sleep and sleep position on CGM performance, we conducted a study in human subjects in which we measured the variability of interstitial CGM data at night as a function of sleeping position. Commercially available sensors were placed for 4 days in the abdominal subcutaneous tissue in healthy, nondiabetic volunteers (four sensors per person, two per side). Nocturnal sleeping position was determined from video recordings and correlated to sensor data.Results:We observed that, although the median of the four sensor readings was typically 70?110 mg/dl during sleep, individual sensors intermittently exhibited aberrant glucose readings ({$>$}25 mg/dl away from median) and that these aberrant readings were strongly correlated with subjects lying on the sensors. We expected and observed that most of these aberrant sleep-position-related CGM readings were sudden decreases in reported glucose values, presumably due to local blood-flow decreases caused by tissue compression. Curiously, in rare cases, the aberrant CGM readings were elevated values.Conclusions:These findings highlight limitations in our understanding of interstitial fluid physiology in the subcutaneous space and have significant implications for the utilization of sensors in the construction of an artificial pancreas.},

We provide evidence that the status of methionine metabolism is sufficient to determine levels of histone methylation by modulating SAM and SAH. This dynamic interaction led to rapid changes in H3K4me3, altered gene transcription, provided feedback regulation to one-carbon metabolism, and could be fully recovered upon restoration of methionine. Modulation of methionine in diet led to changes in metabolism and histone methylation in the liver. In humans, methionine variability in fasting serum was commensurate with concentrations needed for these dynamics and could be~partly explained by diet. Together these findings demonstrate that flux through methionine metabolism and the sensing of methionine availability may allow direct communication to the chromatin state in cells.},

In this article, we present an original peak-calling method (bPeaks) specifically designed to detect transcription factor (TF) binding sites in small eukaryotic genomes, such as in yeasts. As TF interactions with DNA are strong and generate high binding signals, bPeaks uses simple parameters to compare the sequences (reads) obtained from the immunoprecipitation (IP) with those from the control DNA (input). Because yeasts have small genomes ({$<$}20 Mb), our program has the advantage of using ChIPseq information at the single nucleotide level and can explore, in a reasonable computational time, results obtained with different sets of parameter values. Graphical outputs and text files are provided to rapidly assess the relevance of the detected peaks. Taking advantage of the simple promoter structure in yeasts, additional functions were implemented in bPeaks to automatically assign the peaks to promoter regions and retrieve peak coordinates on the DNA sequence for further predictions of regulatory motifs, enriched in the list of peaks. Applications of the bPeaks program to three different ChIPseq datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are presented. Each time, bPeaks allowed us to correctly predict the DNA binding sequence of the studied TF and provided relevant lists of peaks.

Recently there has been some effort to coalesce non-biased high-throughput data, e.g. high density genotyping and genome wide RNA expression, to drive understanding of the molecular basis of disease. However, a stumbling block has been the difficult question of how to leverage this information to identify molecular mechanisms that explain quantitative trait loci (QTL). We have developed a formal statistical hypothesis test, resulting in a p-value, to quantify uncertainty in a causal inference pertaining to a measured factor, e.g. a molecular species, which potentially mediates a known causal association between a locus and a quantitative trait.},

However, questions arise regarding the frequency of abnormal immune responses to wheat and their nature, and it remains unclear whether such responses are diabetes specific. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In type 1 diabetic patients and healthy control subjects, the immune response of peripheral CD3+ T-cells to WPs, ovalbumin, gliadin, {$\alpha$}-gliadin 33-mer peptide, tetanus toxoid, and phytohemagglutinin was measured using a carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) proliferation assay. T\textendash helper cell type 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cytokines were analyzed in WP-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) supernatants, and HLA was analyzed by PCR. RESULTS Of 42 patients, 20 displayed increased CD3+ T-cell proliferation to WPs and were classified as responders; proliferative responses to other dietary antigens were less pronounced. WP-stimulated PBMNCs from patients showed a mixed proinflammatory cytokine response with large amounts of IFN-{$\gamma$}, IL-17A, and increased TNF. HLA-DQ2, the major celiac disease risk gene, was not significantly different. Nearly all responders carried the diabetes risk gene HLA-DR4. Anti-DR antibodies blocked the WP response and inhibited secretion of Th1 and Th17 cytokines. High amounts of WP-stimulated IL-6 were not blocked. CONCLUSIONS T-cell reactivity to WPs was frequently present in type 1 diabetic patients and associated with HLA-DR4 but not HLA-DQ2. The presence of an HLA-DR\textendash restricted Th1 and Th17 response to WPs in a subset of patients indicates a diabetes-related inflammatory state in the gut immune tissues associated with defective oral tolerance and possibly gut barrier dysfunction.},

The discrepancies between the data published previously might be caused by the interference of several factors. To test the effect of overall glycemic control itself, we analyzed the diurnal glycemic profiles of type 2 diabetic patients investigated at different levels of HbA1c. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\textemdash In 290 non\textendash insulin- and non\textendash acarbose-using patients with type 2 diabetes, plasma glucose (PG) concentrations were determined at fasting (8:00 a.m.) and during postprandial and postabsorptive periods (at 11:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 5:00 p.m.). The areas under the curve above fasting PG concentrations (AUC1) and {$>$}6.1 mmol/l (AUC2) were calculated for further evaluation of the relative contributions of postprandial (AUC1/AUC2, \%) and fasting [(AUC2 - AUC1)/AUC2, \%] PG increments to the overall diurnal hyperglycemia. The data were compared over quintiles of HbA1c. RESULTS\textemdash The relative contribution of postprandial glucose decreased progressively from the lowest (69.7\%) to the highest quintile of HbA1c (30.5\%, P {$<$} 0.001), whereas the relative contribution of fasting glucose increased gradually with increasing levels of HbA1c: 30.3\% in the lowest vs. 69.5\% in the highest quintile (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS\textemdash The relative contribution of postprandial glucose excursions is predominant in fairly controlled patients, whereas the contribution of fasting hyperglycemia increases gradually with diabetes worsening. These results could therefore provide a unifying explanation for the discrepancies as observed in previous studies.},

  abstract = {Background: Glycemic variability is an important factor to consider in diabetes management. It can be assessed with multiple glycemic variability metrics and quality of control indices based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) recordings. For this, a robust repeatable calculation is important. A widely used tool for automated assessment is the EasyGV software. The aim of this work is to implement new methods of glycemic variability assessment in EasyGV and to validate implementation of each glucose metric in EasyGV against a reference implementation of the calculations. Methods: Validation data used came from the JDRF CGM study. Validation of the implementation of metrics that are available in EasyGV software v9 was carried out and the following new methods were added and validated: personal glycemic state, index of glycemic control, times in ranges, and glycemic variability percentage. Reference values considered gold standard calculations were derived from MATLAB implementation of each metric. Results: The Pearson correlation coefficient was above 0.98 for all metrics, except for mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (r = 0.87) as EasyGV implements a fuzzy logic approach to assessment of variability. Bland\textendash Altman plots demonstrated validation of the new software. Conclusions: The new freely available EasyGV software v10 (www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/technology-outputs/ easygv) is a validated robust tool for analyzing different glycemic variabilities and control metrics.},

  abstract = {Bayesian methods furnish an attractive approach to inference in generalized linear mixed models. In the absence of subjective prior information for the random-effect variance components, these analyses are typically conducted using either the standard invariant prior for normal responses or diffuse conjugate priors. Previous work has pointed out serious difficulties with both strategies, and we show here that as in normal mixed models, the standard invariant prior leads to an improper posterior distribution for generalized linear mixed models. This article proposes and investigates two alternative reference (i.e., ``objective'' or ``noninformative'') priors: an approximate uniform shrinkage prior and an approximate Jeffreys's prior. We give conditions for the existence of the posterior distribution under any prior for the variance components in conjunction with a uniform prior for the fixed effects. The approximate uniform shrinkage prior is shown to satisfy these conditions for several families of distributions, in some cases under mild constraints on the data. Simulation studies conducted using a logit-normal model reveal that the approximate uniform shrinkage prior improves substantially on a plug-in empirical Bayes rule and fully Bayesian methods using diffuse conjugate specifications. The methodology is illustrated on a seizure dataset.},

To study this, we examined 194 circulating inflammatory proteins in subjects from three independent cohorts with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In each cohort, we identified an extremely robust kidney risk inflammatory signature (KRIS), consisting of 17 proteins enriched in tumor necrosis factor-receptor superfamily members, that was associated with a 10-year risk of end-stage renal disease. All these proteins had a systemic, non-kidney source. Our prospective study findings provide strong evidence that KRIS proteins contribute to the inflammatory process underlying end-stage renal disease development in both types of diabetes. These proteins point to new therapeutic targets and new prognostic tests to identify subjects at risk of end-stage renal disease, as well as biomarkers to measure responses to treatment of diabetic kidney disease.},

We introduce a data and task abstraction, and argue that the problem of analyzing such diseases based on genealogical, clinical, and genetic data can be mapped to a multivariate graph visualization problem. The main contribution of our design study is a novel visual representation for tree-like, multivariate graphs, which we apply to genealogies and clinical data about the individuals in these families. We introduce data-driven aggregation methods to scale to multiple families. By designing the genealogy graph layout to align with a tabular view, we are able to incorporate extensive, multivariate attributes in the analysis of the genealogy without cluttering the graph.

First-degree relatives of type 1 DM individuals were recruited from the Denver metropolitan area.ParticipantsWe enrolled 1183 children at increased type 1 DM risk, defined as either HLA genotype or having a first-degree relative with type 1 DM, at birth and followed them prospectively. We obtained exposure and outcome measures for 76\% of enrolled children. Participants had variable lengths of follow-up (9 months to 9 years).Main Outcome MeasuresBlood draws for the detection of insulin autoantibody, glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody, or IA-2 autoantibody were performed at 9, 15, and 24 months and annually thereafter. Children with IA (n = 34) were defined as those testing positive for at least 1 of the autoantibodies on 2 or more consecutive visits and who tested positive or had diabetes on their most recent visit.ResultsChildren initially exposed to cereals between ages 0 and 3 months (hazard ratio [HR], 4.32; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-9.35) and those who were exposed at 7 months or older (HR, 5.36; 95\% CI, 2.08-13.8) had increased hazard of IA compared with those who were exposed during the fourth through sixth month, after adjustment for HLA genotype, family history of type 1 DM, ethnicity, and maternal age. In children who were positive for the HLA-DRB1*03/04,DQB8 genotype, adjusted HRs were 5.55 (95\% CI, 1.92-16.03) and 12.53 (95\% CI, 3.19-49.23) for initial cereal exposure between ages 0 to 3 months and at 7 months or older, respectively.ConclusionThere may be a window of exposure to cereals in infancy outside which initial exposure increases IA risk in susceptible children.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Genetic risk scores (GRS) have been developed that differentiate individuals with type 1 diabetes from those with other forms of diabetes and are starting to be used for population screening; however, most studies were conducted in European-ancestry populations. This study identifies novel genetic variants associated with type 1 diabetes risk in African-ancestry participants and develops an African-specific GRS. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We generated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data with the ImmunoChip on 1,021 African-ancestry participants with type 1 diabetes and 2,928 control participants. HLA class I and class II alleles were imputed using SNP2HLA. Logistic regression models were used to identify genome-wide significant (P {$<$} 5.0 \texttimes{} 10-8) SNPs associated with type 1 diabetes in the African-ancestry samples and validate SNPs associated with risk in known European-ancestry loci (P {$<$} 2.79 \texttimes{} 10-5). RESULTS African-specific (HLA-DQA1*03:01-HLA-DQB1*02:01) and known European-ancestry HLA haplotypes (HLA-DRB1*03:01-HLA-DQA1*05:01-HLA-DQB1*02:01, HLA-DRB1*04:01-HLA-DQA1*03:01-HLA-DQB1*03:02) were significantly associated with type 1 diabetes risk. Among European-ancestry defined non-HLA risk loci, six risk loci were significantly associated with type 1 diabetes in subjects of African ancestry. An African-specific GRS provided strong prediction of type 1 diabetes risk (area under the curve 0.871), performing significantly better than a European-based GRS and two polygenic risk scores in independent discovery and validation cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Genetic risk of type 1 diabetes includes ancestry-specific, disease-associated variants. The GRS developed here provides improved prediction of type 1 diabetes in African-ancestry subjects and a means to identify groups of individuals who would benefit from immune monitoring for early detection of islet autoimmunity.},

Loss of estrogen receptor expression is an important means of hormone resistance, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood.

Estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cells growing in culture lack estrogen receptor mRNA, have a higher capacity to methylate DNA, and display extensive methylation of the CpG island in the 5{${'}$} promoter region of the estrogen receptor gene, which would correlate with silencing of expression. These results suggest that abnormal methylation could account for transcriptional inactivation of the estrogen receptor gene and subsequent hormone resistance in some human breast cancers.},

  abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is widely used to detect genome-wide interactions between a protein of interest and DNA in vivo. Loci showing strong enrichment over adjacent background regions are typically considered to be sites of binding. Insufficient attention has been given to systematic artifacts inherent to the ChIP-seq procedure that might generate a misleading picture of protein binding to certain loci. We show here that unrelated transcription factors appear to consistently bind to the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes in yeast. Strikingly, several types of negative control experiments, including a protein that is not expected to bind chromatin, also showed similar patterns of strong binding within gene bodies. These false positive signals were evident across sequencing platforms and immunoprecipitation protocols, as well as in previously published datasets from other labs. We show that these false positive signals derive from high rates of transcription, and are inherent to the ChIP procedure, although they are exacerbated by sequencing library construction procedures. This expression bias is strong enough that a known transcriptional repressor like Tup1 can erroneously appear to be an activator. Another type of background bias stems from the inherent nucleosomal structure of chromatin, and can potentially make it seem like certain factors bind nucleosomes even when they don't. Our analysis suggests that a mock ChIP sample offers a better normalization control for the expression bias, whereas the ChIP input is more appropriate for the nucleosomal periodicity bias. While these controls alleviate the effect of the biases to some extent, they are unable to eliminate it completely. Caution is therefore warranted regarding the interpretation of data that seemingly show the association of various transcription and chromatin factors with highly transcribed genes in yeast.},

This is a common setup in many data-driven scientific fields and we argue that statistical inference can benefit from an analysis that takes into account the distributional changes across environments. In particular, it is useful to distinguish between stable and unstable predictors, i.e., predictors which have a fixed or a changing functional dependence on the response, respectively. We introduce stabilized regression which explicitly enforces stability and thus improves generalization performance to previously unseen environments. Our work is motivated by an application in systems biology. Using multiomic data, we demonstrate how hypothesis generation about gene function can benefit from stabilized regression. We believe that a similar line of arguments for exploiting heterogeneity in data can be powerful for many other applications as well. We draw a theoretical connection between multi-environment regression and causal models, which allows to graphically characterize stable versus unstable functional dependence on the response. Formally, we introduce the notion of a stable blanket which is a subset of the predictors that lies between the direct causal predictors and the Markov blanket. We prove that this set is optimal in the sense that a regression based on these predictors minimizes the mean squared prediction error given that the resulting regression generalizes to unseen new environments.},

We focus on the variable subset selection for regression and classification and perform several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The results show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to relatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This can also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint, best results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the full encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over the candidate models. If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly simplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model is projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially less prone to overfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the projection method appears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the model selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation outside the searching process both for guiding the model size selection and assessing the predictive performance of the finally selected model.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in American men. Development and progression of clinically localized prostate cancer is highly dependent on androgen signaling. Metastatic tumors are initially responsive to anti-androgen therapy, however become resistant to this regimen upon progression. Genomic and proteomic studies have implicated a role for androgen in regulating metabolic processes in prostate cancer. However, there have been no metabolomic profiling studies conducted thus far that have examined androgen-regulated biochemical processes in prostate cancer. Here, we have used unbiased metabolomic profiling coupled with enrichment-based bioprocess mapping to obtain insights into the biochemical alterations mediated by androgen in prostate cancer cell lines. Our findings indicate that androgen exposure results in elevation of amino acid metabolism and alteration of methylation potential in prostate cancer cells. Further, metabolic phenotyping studies confirm higher flux through pathways associated with amino acid metabolism in prostate cancer cells treated with androgen. These findings provide insight into the potential biochemical processes regulated by androgen signaling in prostate cancer. Clinically, if validated, these pathways could be exploited to develop therapeutic strategies that supplement current androgen ablative treatments while the observed androgen-regulated metabolic signatures could be employed as biomarkers that presage the development of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.},

Although significant progress has been made in elucidating the genetics of T1D in recent years, the non-genetic component has remained poorly defined. We hypothesized that epigenetic variation could underlie some of the non-genetic component of T1D aetiology and, thus, performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for this disease. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of purified CD14+ monocytes (an immune effector cell type relevant to T1D pathogenesis) from 15 T1D\textendash discordant MZ twin pairs. This identified 132 different CpG sites at which the direction of the intra-MZ pair DNA methylation difference significantly correlated with the diabetic state, i.e. T1D\textendash associated methylation variable positions (T1D\textendash MVPs). We confirmed these T1D\textendash MVPs display statistically significant intra-MZ pair DNA methylation differences in the expected direction in an independent set of T1D\textendash discordant MZ pairs (P = 0.035). Then, to establish the temporal origins of the T1D\textendash MVPs, we generated two further genome-wide datasets and established that, when compared with controls, T1D\textendash MVPs are enriched in singletons both before (P = 0.001) and at (P = 0.015) disease diagnosis, and also in singletons positive for diabetes-associated autoantibodies but disease-free even after 12 years follow-up (P = 0.0023). Combined, these results suggest that T1D\textendash MVPs arise very early in the etiological process that leads to overt T1D. Our EWAS of T1D represents an important contribution toward understanding the etiological role of epigenetic variation in type 1 diabetes, and it is also the first systematic analysis of the temporal origins of disease-associated epigenetic variation for any human complex disease.},

Method:               We retrospectively reviewed data from 892 patients with type 1 diabetes insured by Colorado Medicaid (Colorado Health Program [CHP] and CHP+, Colorado Medicaid expansion). Demographics, insulin pump usage, CGM usage, and hemoglobin A1c (A1c) were extracted from the medical record. Data downloaded into CGM software at clinic appointments were reviewed to determine 30-day use prior to appointments. Subjects with some exposure to CGM were compared to subjects never exposed to CGM, and we examined the effect of CGM use on glycemic control.                                         Results:               Twenty percent of subjects had some exposure to CGM with a median of 22 [interquartile range 8, 29] days wear. Sixty one percent of CGM users had {$>$}85\% sensor wear. Subjects using CGM were more likely to be younger ( P {$<$} .001), have shorter diabetes duration ( P {$<$} .001), and be non-Hispanic White ( P {$<$} .001) than nonusers. After adjusting for age and diabetes duration, combined pump and CGM users had a lower A1c than those using neither technology ( P = .006). Lower A1c was associated with greater CGM use ( P = .002) and increased percent time in range ( P {$<$} .001).                                         Conclusion:               Pediatric Medicaid patients successfully utilized CGM. Expansion of Medicaid coverage for CGM may help improve glycemic control and lessen disparities in clinical outcomes within this population.},

  abstract = {Autoimmunity causing insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) begins in early childhood due to interactions between genes and unknown environmental factors that may be identified through follow-up of a large cohort of genetically susceptible children. Such a cohort has been established using a simple and rapid cord blood screening for HLA alleles. The DRB1 and DQB1 second exon sequences were co-amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and hybridized with single and pooled sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. Four individual probes were used to detect the susceptibility alleles DRB1*03, DRB1*04, and DQBl*0302 as well as the usually protective DRB1*15/16 (DR2) alleles. In addition, pooled probes allow the distinction of DR3/3 from the DR3/x genotype (where x is neither DR2, 3, nor 4) and DR4/4 from DR4/x. Among 5000 newborns from the general Denver population, we have found the high-risk genotype (DRBl*03/ DRB1*04, DQBl*0302) to be present in 2.4\% of non-Hispanic whites, 2.8\% of Hispanics, and 1.6\% of African Americans. The moderate-risk genotypes (DRB1*04, DQBl*0302/DRBl*04, DQB1*0302, DRB1*04, DQBl*0302/x, or DRBl*03/DRBl*03) are present in 17 \% of American non-Hispanic whites, 24\% of Hispanics and in 10\% of African Americans. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale newborn screening for genes associated with IDDM. The ultimate role for such a screening in future routine prediction and prevention of IDDM will depend on the availability of an effective and acceptable form of clinical intervention.},

In this work we focus on the identification of microbial signatures, groups of microbial taxa that are predictive of a phenotype of interest. We do this by acknowledging the compositional nature of the microbiome and the fact that it carries relative information. Thus, instead of defining a microbial signature as a linear combination in real space corresponding to the abundances of a group of taxa, we consider microbial signatures given by the geometric means of data from two groups of taxa whose relative abundances, or balance, are associated with the response variable of interest. In this work we present selbal, a greedy stepwise algorithm for selection of balances or microbial signatures that preserves the principles of compositional data analysis. We illustrate the algorithm with 16S rRNA abundance data from a Crohn's microbiome study and an HIV microbiome study. IMPORTANCE We propose a new algorithm for the identification of microbial signatures. These microbial signatures can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or prediction of therapeutic response based on an individual's specific microbiota.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Enterovirus infections are frequent in infants and may cause severe complications. We set out to assess whether breastfeeding can protect against these infections and whether such an effect is related to maternal antibodies in breast milk or in the peripheral circulation of the infant. METHODS. One hundred fifty infants who were prospectively followed up from birth were monitored for enterovirus infections. The duration of breastfeeding was recorded, and maternal breast milk and blood samples were regularly taken at 3-month intervals for the detection of enterovirus antibodies and RNA. Maternal serum was available from early pregnancy, delivery, and 3 months postpartum. RESULTS. Enterovirus infections were frequent and were diagnosed in 43\% of infants before the age of 1 year and in 15\% of the mothers during pregnancy. Infants exclusively breastfed for {$>$}2 weeks had fewer enterovirus infections by the age of 1 year compared with those exclusively breastfed for {$\leq$}2 weeks (0.38 vs 0.59 infections per child). High maternal antibody levels in serum and in breast milk were associated with a reduced frequency of infections. This effect was seen only in those infants breastfed {$>$}2 weeks, indicating that breast milk antibodies mediate this effect. Enterovirus RNA was not found in any of the breast milk samples. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that breastfeeding has a protective effect against enterovirus infections in infancy. This effect seems to be mediated primarily by maternal antibodies in breast milk.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               One goal of multi-omic studies is to identify interpretable predictive models for outcomes of interest, with analytes drawn from multiple omes. Such findings could support refined biological insight and hypothesis generation. However, standard analytical approaches are not designed to be ``ome aware.'' Thus, some researchers analyze data from one ome at a time, and then combine predictions across omes. Others resort to correlation studies, cataloging pairwise relationships, but lacking an obvious approach for cohesive and interpretable summaries of these catalogs.                                         Methods               We present a novel workflow for building predictive regression models from network neighborhoods in multi-omic networks. First, we generate pairwise regression models across all pairs of analytes from all omes, encoding the resulting ``top table'' of relationships in a network. Then, we build predictive logistic regression models using the analytes in network neighborhoods of interest. We call this method CANTARE (Consolidated Analysis of Network Topology And Regression Elements).                                         Results                                We applied CANTARE to previously published data from healthy controls and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consisting of three omes: gut microbiome, metabolomics, and microbial-derived enzymes. We identified 8 unique predictive models with AUC\,{$>$}\,0.90. The number of predictors in these models ranged from 3 to 13. We compare the results of CANTARE to random forests and elastic-net penalized regressions, analyzing AUC, predictions, and predictors. CANTARE AUC values were competitive with those generated by random forests and~~penalized regressions. The top 3 CANTARE models had a greater dynamic range of predicted probabilities than did random forests and penalized regressions (p-value\,=\,1.35\,\texttimes\,10                 \textendash 5                 ). CANTARE models were significantly more likely to prioritize predictors from multiple omes than were the alternatives (p-value\,=\,0.005). We also showed that predictive models from a network based on pairwise models with an interaction term for IBD have higher AUC than predictive models built from a correlation network (p-value\,=\,0.016). R scripts and a CANTARE User's Guide are available at                 https://sourceforge.net/projects/cytomelodics/files/CANTARE/                 .                                                        Conclusion               CANTARE offers a flexible approach for building parsimonious, interpretable multi-omic models. These models yield quantitative and directional effect sizes for predictors and support the generation of hypotheses for follow-up investigation.},

Pairwise linear regressions between microbial and host immune features provide one approach for quantifying relationships between ``omes'', and the differences in these relationships across study cohorts or arms. This approach yields a top table of candidate results. However, the top table alone lacks the detail that domain experts such as microbiologists and immunologists need to vet candidate results for follow-up experiments.},

  abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

  abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the `hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

The aim of our study was to dissect the contribution of epigenetic factors, particularly, DNA methylation (DNAm), to the incomplete penetrance of T1D. We performed DNAm profiling in lymphocyte cell lines from 3 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for T1D and 6 MZ twin pairs concordant for the disease using HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. This assay assesses the methylation state of 27,578 CpG sites, mostly located within proximal promoter regions. We identified 88 CpG sites displaying significant methylation changes in all T1D-discordant MZ twin pairs. Functional annotation of the genes with distinct CpG methylation profiles in T1D samples showed differential DNAm of immune response and defense response pathways between affected and unaffected twins. Integration of DNAm data with GWAS data mapped several known T1D associated genes, HLA, INS, IL-2RB, CD226, which showed significant differences in DNAm between affected and unaffected of twins. Our findings suggest that abnormalities of DNA methylation patterns, known to regulate gene transcription, may be involved in the pathogenesis of T1D.},

A standardized protocol was used for extracting data from full-text articles identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE. For plasma and serum samples, metabolomic profiles were affected by fasting status, hemolysis, collection time, processing delays, particularly at room temperature, and repeated freeze/thaw cycles. For urine samples, collection time and fasting, centrifugation conditions, filtration and the use of additives, normalization procedures and multiple freeze/thaw cycles were found to alter metabolomic findings. Consideration of the effects of pre-analytical factors is a particularly important issue for epidemiological studies where samples are often collected in nonclinical settings and various locations and are subjected to time and temperature delays prior being to processed and frozen for storage.},

As is the case for microarrays and other high-throughput technologies, data from new high-throughput sequencing technologies are subject to technological and biological biases and systematic errors that can impact downstream analyses. Only when these issues can be readily identified and reliably adjusted for will clinical applications of these new technologies be feasible. Although much work remains to be done in this area, we describe consistently observed biases that should be taken into account when analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. In this article, we review current knowledge about these biases, discuss their impact on analysis results, and propose solutions.},

This framework allows us to derive conditional (post-selection) hypothesis tests at any step of forward stepwise or least angle regression, or any step along the lasso regularization path, because, as it turns out, selection events for these procedures can be expressed as polyhedral constraints on y. The p-values associated with these tests are exactly uniform under the null distribution, in finite samples, yielding exact Type I error control. The tests can also be inverted to produce confidence intervals for appropriate underlying regression parameters. The R package selectiveInference, freely available on the CRAN repository, implements the new inference tools described in this article. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {The lasso is a popular tool for sparse linear regression, especially for problems in which the number of variables p exceeds the number of observations n. But when p{$>$}n, the lasso criterion is not strictly convex, and hence it may not have a unique minimum. An important question is: when is the lasso solution well-defined (unique)? We review results from the literature, which show that if the predictor variables are drawn from a continuous probability distribution, then there is a unique lasso solution with probability one, regardless of the sizes of n and p. We also show that this result extends easily to \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$ penalized minimization problems over a wide range of loss functions. A second important question is: how can we deal with the case of non-uniqueness in lasso solutions? In light of the aforementioned result, this case really only arises when some of the predictor variables are discrete, or when some post-processing has been performed on continuous predictor measurements. Though we certainly cannot claim to provide a complete answer to such a broad question, we do present progress towards understanding some aspects of non-uniqueness. First, we extend the LARS algorithm for computing the lasso solution path to cover the non-unique case, so that this path algorithm works for any predictor matrix. Next, we derive a simple method for computing the component-wise uncertainty in lasso solutions of any given problem instance, based on linear programming. Finally, we review results from the literature on some of the unifying properties of lasso solutions, and also point out particular forms of solutions that have distinctive properties.},

  abstract = {Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) can occur at any age, with a peak in incidence around puberty. Classification between T1D and type 2 diabetes becomes more challenging with increasing age of onset of T1D over time develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The main susceptibility is conferred with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Some of the geographic variation in incidence and familial aggregation is explained by differences in HLA haplotypes. In many populations, the incidence is somewhat higher in males than in females, and a 1.3- to 2.0-fold male excess in incidence after about 15~years of age exists in most populations. The incidence of childhood-onset T1D varies markedly among countries. East Asian and native American populations have low incidences (approximately 0.1\textendash 8 per 100 000/year), while the highest rates are found in Finland ({$>$}60 per 100 000/year), Sardinia (40 per 100 000/year), and Sweden (47 per 100 000/year). The risk is highest in European-derived populations. About 10~\%\textendash 20~\% of newly diagnosed childhood cases of T1D have an affected first-degree relative. Those with an affected sibling or parent have a cumulative risk of 3~\%\textendash 7~\% up to about 20~years of age, as compared with {$<$}1~\% in the general population. The cumulative incidence among the monozygotic co-twins of persons with T1D is less than 50~\%. Thus, the majority of genetically predisposed people do not develop T1D. Studies assessing temporal trends have shown that the incidence of childhood-onset T1D has increased in all parts of the world. The average relative increase is 3~\%\textendash 4~\% per calendar year. For instance, in Finland, the incidence today is 5 times higher than 60~years ago. At the same time, the age at onset of T1D in children has become younger. It is strongly believed that nongenetic factors are important for the development of T1D and its increase, but the causative evidence is missing. The causes for this increasing trend and current epidemic still remain unknown.},

Recently, third-generation/long-read methods appeared, which can produce genome assemblies of unprecedented quality. Moreover, these technologies can directly detect epigenetic modifications on native DNA and allow whole-transcript sequencing without the need for assembly.

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabonomics is of growing importance for discovery of human disease biomarkers. Identification and validation of disease biomarkers using statistical significance analysis (SSA) is critical for translation to clinical practice. SSA is performed by assessing a null hypothesis test using a derivative of the Student's t test, e.g., a Welch's t test. Choosing how to correct the significance level for rejecting null hypotheses in the case of multiple testing to maintain a constant family-wise type I error rate is a common problem in such tests. The multiple testing problem arises because the likelihood of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis, i.e., a false positive, grows as the number of tests applied to the same data set increases. Several methods have been introduced to address this problem. Bonferroni correction (BC) assumes all variables are independent and therefore sacrifices sensitivity for detecting true positives in partially dependent data sets. False discovery rate (FDR) methods are more sensitive than BC but uniformly ascribe highest stringency to lowest p value variables. Here, we introduce standard deviation step down (SDSD), which is more sensitive and appropriate than BC for partially dependent data sets. Sensitivity and type I error rate of SDSD can be adjusted based on the degree of variable dependency. SDSD generates fundamentally different profiles of critical p values compared with FDR methods potentially leading to reduced type II error rates. SDSD is increasingly sensitive for more concentrated metabolites. SDSD is demonstrated using NMR-based metabonomics data collected on three different breast cancer cell line extracts.},

The increase of genus Fusobacterium abundance was correlated with a decrease in the level of 4-hydroxybutyric acid (4-HB) and expression of immune-related peptidase inhibitor 16 (PI16), Fc Receptor Like A (FCRLA) and Lymphocyte Specific Protein 1 (LSP1). The decrease in the abundance of another potentially 4-HB-associated genus, Prevotella 2, was also found to be correlated with the down-regulated expression of metallothionein 1 M (MT1M). Additionally, the increase of glutamic acid-related family Halomonadaceae was correlated with the decreased expression of reelin (RELN). The decreased abundance of genus Paeniclostridium and genus Enterococcus were correlated with increased lactic acid level, and were also linked to the expression change of Phospholipase C Beta 1 (PLCB1) and Immunoglobulin Superfamily Member 9 (IGSF9) respectively. Interestingly, 4-HB, glutamic acid and lactic acid are all butyrate precursors, which may modify gene expression by epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation. Conclusions: Our study identified associations between previously reported CRC-related microbial taxa, butyraterelated metabolites and DNA methylation-associated gene expression in tumour and normal colonic mucosa tissues from CRC patients, which uncovered a possible mechanism of the role of microbiome in the carcinogenesis of CRC. In addition, these findings offer insight into potential new biomarkers, therapeutic and/or prevention strategies for CRC.},

Plasma levels of asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA, endogenous nitric oxide synthase [NOS] inhibitor), symmetrical dimethylarginine (SDMA, which lacks NOS inhibitory activity), N-mono-methylarginine (MMA, a potent NOS inhibitor), methyl-lysine (Methyl-Lys, an unrelated methylated amino acid), arginine, and its major catabolites (citrulline and ornithine) were quantified simultaneously by stable isotope dilution HPLC with online electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and adjusted for traditional risk factors, C-reactive protein, and estimated creatinine clearance. High SDMA levels (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95\%CI, 1.1 to 2.6, P{$<$}0.001), low MMA (adjusted OR 0.5, 95\%CI 0.4 to 0.8, P=0.007), but not ADMA (adjusted OR 1.3, 95\%CI 0.88 to 2.0, P=0.177) were associated with increased prevalence of significantly obstructive CAD. Elevated levels of SDMA (adjusted Hazard Ratio [HR] 2.4, 95\%CI 1.2 to 4.6, P=0.009), ADMA (adjusted HR 2.2, 95\%CI 1.2 to 4.0, P=0.015), as well as an integrated index of arginine methylation [ArgMI=(ADMA+SDMA)/MMA] (adjusted HR 2.4, 95\%CI 1.3 to 4.5, P=0.006) were significant independent predictors of incident MACE. ArgMI was predictive of incident MACE even following adjustments for global arginine bioavailability, particularly within secondary prevention patients.Conclusions\textemdash{} ADMA, SDMA, and the integrated quantification of arginine methylation (in the form of a methylation index) provided independent risk prediction for both significantly obstructive CAD and incident MACE in stable patients undergoing cardiac evaluation. These results suggest that factors beyond direct NOS inhibition contribute to the clinical associations between methylarginines and CAD outcomes.},

We found that ACL is required for increases in histone acetylation in response to growth factor stimulation and during differentiation, and that glucose availability can affect histone acetylation in an ACL-dependent manner. Together, these findings suggest that ACL activity is required to link growth factor\textendash induced increases in nutrient metabolism to the regulation of histone acetylation and gene expression.

The mutations universally affect codons 132 in IDH1 and 172 in IDH2 and result in decreased enzymatic activity. The oncogenic pathway triggered by IDH mutations may involve the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor pathway as well as the acquisition of a novel (gain of enzymatic) function consuming NADPH and generating {$\alpha$}-hydroxyglutarate. Most intriguingly, IDH mutations are observed in {$\sim$}70\textendash 80\% of grade II/III gliomas and the majority of secondary glioblastomas, but only 10\% of primary glioblastomas, suggesting a different cellular origin of the gliomas, which had previously been viewed as a multistep process of malignant progression.

Thoughtful experimental design and choice of analysis tools are critical to ensure high-quality data and interpretable results. Important considerations for experimental design include number of replicates, whether to collect paired-end or single-end reads, sequence length, and sequencing depth. Common analysis steps in all RNA-seq experiments include quality control, read alignment, assigning reads to genes or transcripts, and estimating gene or transcript abundance. Our aims are two-fold: to make recommendations for common components of experimental design and assess tool capabilities for each of these steps. We also test tools designed to detect differential expression, since this is the most widespread application of RNA-seq. We hope that these analyses will help guide those who are new to RNA-seq and will generate discussion about remaining needs for tool improvement and development. Curr. Protoc. Hum.

These new approaches are at least an order of magnitude faster in high dimensions and drastically reduce computer memory requirements.

The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation CGM randomized trials provided a large dataset of longitudinal CGM data for this type of analysis.Methods: The analysis included 185 subjects who had 334 3-month intervals of CGM data meeting specific criteria. For various glucose indices, correlations (r2) were computed for the entire 3-month interval versus selected sampling periods ranging from 3 to 15 days. Other computed agreement measures included median relative absolute difference, values within\,{$\pm$}\,10\% and\,{$\pm$}\,20\% of full value, and median absolute difference.Results: As would be expected, the more days of glucose data that were sampled, the higher the correlation with the full 3 months of data. For 3 days of sampling, the r2 value ranged from 0.32 to 0.47, evaluating mean glucose, percentage of values 71\textendash 180\,mg/dL, percentage of values {$>$}180\,mg/dL, percentage of values {$\leq$}70\,mg/dL, and coefficient of variation; in contrast, for 15 days of sampling, the r2 values ranged from 0.66 to 0.75. The results were similar when the analysis intervals were stratified by age group (8\textendash 14, 15\textendash 24, and {$\geq$}25 years), by baseline hemoglobin A1c level ({$<$}7.0\% and {$\geq$}7.0\%), and by CGM device type.Conclusions and Interpretation: Our data suggest that a 12\textendash 15-day period of monitoring every 3 months may be needed to optimally assess overall glucose control. Shorter periods of sampling can be useful, but the correlation with 3-month measures of glycemic control is lower.},

GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

  abstract = {We propose a nonparametric method to perform functional principal components analysis for the case of sparse longitudinal data. The method aims at irregularly spaced longitudinal data, where the number of repeated measurements available per subject is small. In contrast, classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. We assume that the repeated measurements are located randomly with a random number of repetitions for each subject and are determined by an underlying smooth random (subject-specific) trajectory plus measurement errors. Basic elements of our approach are the parsimonious estimation of the covariance structure and mean function of the trajectories, and the estimation of the variance of the measurement errors. The eigenfunction basis is estimated from the data, and functional principal components score estimates are obtained by a conditioning step. This conditional estimation method is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. A key step is the derivation of asymptotic consistency and distribution results under mild conditions, using tools from functional analysis. Functional data analysis for sparse longitudinal data enables prediction of individual smooth trajectories even if only one or few measurements are available for a subject. Asymptotic pointwise and simultaneous confidence bands are obtained for predicted individual trajectories, based on asymptotic distributions, for simultaneous bands under the assumption of a finite number of components. Model selection techniques, such as the Akaike information criterion, are used to choose the model dimension corresponding to the number of eigenfunctions in the model. The methods are illustrated with a simulation study, longitudinal CD4 data for a sample of AIDS patients, and time-course gene expression data for the yeast cell cycle.},

An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for `soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the `weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its `unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

MACS also uses a dynamic Poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome, allowing for more robust predictions. MACS compares favorably to existing ChIP-Seq peak-finding algorithms, and is freely available.},

  abstract = {A great deal of interest has recently focused on conducting inference on the parameters in a high-dimensional linear model. In this paper, we consider a simple and very na\textbackslash "\{i\}ve two-step procedure for this task, in which we (i) fit a lasso model in order to obtain a subset of the variables, and (ii) fit a least squares model on the lasso-selected set. Conventional statistical wisdom tells us that we cannot make use of the standard statistical inference tools for the resulting least squares model (such as confidence intervals and \$p\$-values), since we peeked at the data twice: once in running the lasso, and again in fitting the least squares model. However, in this paper, we show that under a certain set of assumptions, with high probability, the set of variables selected by the lasso is identical to the one selected by the noiseless lasso and is hence deterministic. Consequently, the na\textbackslash "\{i\}ve two-step approach can yield asymptotically valid inference. We utilize this finding to develop the \textbackslash emph\{na\textbackslash "ive confidence interval\}, which can be used to draw inference on the regression coefficients of the model selected by the lasso, as well as the \textbackslash emph\{na\textbackslash "ive score test\}, which can be used to test the hypotheses regarding the full-model regression coefficients.},
